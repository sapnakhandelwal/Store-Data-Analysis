# Store-Data-Analysis
Analyzing the Store data in MySQL

Dataset : I have create-db-store-copy file

Finding -
1. Initial file was having 6 Tables - (EER diagram, Schema)
2. File is showing some error during run time

Analysis -
1. I identified the error in the file
2. After rectifiying the erroe, new file is containing 7 Tables
3. I wrote different queries across all the tables
4. I practice Join syntax in MySQL
5. I practice how to find and calculate null values in MySQL
